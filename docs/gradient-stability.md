### **Why Are There Multiple Ways to Backpropagate Through a Differential Equation?**

When solving differential equations (DEs) and computing gradients (e.g., with respect to initial conditions or parameters), the question of *how to propagate gradients* arises. This is because different methods offer trade-offs between **accuracy**, **memory usage**, and **computational efficiency**. The two primary approaches are:

---

### **1. Discretize-then-Optimize** (Backpropagation Through the Solver)
- **Method**: 
  - Numerically solve the differential equation forward in time to get the solution.
  - Apply autodifferentiation (AD) through the internals of the solver itself to compute gradients.
  - This means the solver steps (e.g., Runge-Kutta steps) are treated as part of the computational graph and differentiated directly.
  
- **Advantages**:
  - Gradients are **accurate** because they reflect the actual discretized numerical solution.
  - The method is conceptually simpler when leveraging modern AD tools.

- **Disadvantages**:
  - **Memory-intensive**: To backpropagate, all intermediate states (or checkpoints) must be stored or recomputed.
  - Cannot use **forward-mode autodifferentiation** effectively (e.g., for Jacobians).

- **Practical Notes**:
  - This method often employs **checkpointing** (e.g., saving intermediate states at fixed intervals) to reduce memory use. 
  - It is the default in tools like Diffrax under `diffrax.RecursiveCheckpointAdjoint`.

---

### **2. Optimize-then-Discretize** (Adjoint Method)
- **Method**:
  - Compute the gradients **analytically** from the ODE using the adjoint method.
  - This gives a backward-in-time ODE for the gradient information (called adjoint variables).
  - Numerically solve this adjoint ODE backward in time to compute the gradients.

- **Advantages**:
  - **Memory-efficient**: Instead of storing intermediate states, the forward ODE is re-simulated as needed during the backward pass.
  - Supports larger-scale problems with long integration times or high-dimensional systems.

- **Disadvantages**:
  - Gradients are **approximate**, as numerical errors accumulate in the backward ODE integration.
  - Sensitive to the numerical stability of the adjoint ODE solver.

- **Practical Notes**:
  - This method is preferred in scenarios where memory is the limiting factor, such as simulations with a high number of time steps.
  - Used in tools like Diffrax under `diffrax.BacksolveAdjoint`.

### **Key Differences Between the Two Methods**

| **Criterion**          | **Discretize-then-Optimize**               | **Optimize-then-Discretize**            |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Memory Usage**       | High (stores intermediate states)          | Low (re-simulates forward states)       |
| **Gradient Accuracy**  | High (exact for the discretized solution)  | Approximate (numerical error in adjoint)|
| **Implementation**     | Differentiates through solver steps        | Solves adjoint ODE backward in time     |
| **Computation Speed**  | Slower due to memory demands               | Faster for memory-constrained problems  |

### **Diffrax Implementation Options**

#### **1. diffrax.RecursiveCheckpointAdjoint (Discretize-then-Optimize)**
- **How it works**: Backpropagates directly through the numerical solver using a checkpointing scheme to balance memory and computation.
- **Memory Usage**: Scales with the number of checkpoints (fewer checkpoints â†’ lower memory usage).
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of time steps.
- **When to Use**: Preferred for most problems unless memory constraints are severe.
- **Limitations**: Only supports reverse-mode autodifferentiation, not forward-mode.

---

#### **2. diffrax.BacksolveAdjoint (Optimize-then-Discretize)**
- **How it works**: Solves the continuous adjoint equations backward in time to propagate gradient information.
- **Memory Usage**: Very low, as forward states are re-simulated during the backward pass.
- **Gradient Accuracy**: Only approximate, due to numerical errors in adjoint ODE integration.
- **When to Use**: Useful for memory-constrained scenarios or very large problems.
- **Limitations**: Limited gradient computation support (e.g., cannot compute gradients for closure variables).

---

### **Why Are These Approaches Useful?**

The choice between "discretize-then-optimize" and "optimize-then-discretize" depends on the nature of the problem:
- If **memory is a constraint**, the adjoint method (optimize-then-discretize) provides a practical solution.
- If **accuracy is critical**, backpropagating through the solver (discretize-then-optimize) is preferred, as it accurately reflects the numerical solution.
  
Both methods reflect fundamental trade-offs in computational science, balancing precision, resource usage, and scalability for real-world applications.
